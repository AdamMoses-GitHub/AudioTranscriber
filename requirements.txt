# Audio Transcriber - Python Requirements
# Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Core dependencies - PyTorch with CUDA support
# For NVIDIA GPU support (recommended for faster transcription):
torch>=2.0.0              # Install GPU version with:
                          #   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
                          # For CPU-only (slower):
                          #   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
                          # Verify GPU: python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"

openai-whisper>=20231117  # OpenAI's Whisper speech recognition model

# Use pre-built av package to avoid compilation issues on Windows
av>=11.0.0               # Audio/video processing (dependency of faster-whisper)
faster-whisper>=0.9.0    # Optimized Whisper implementation (CPU/GPU)

# Audio processing libraries
pydub>=0.25.1            # Audio file manipulation and format conversion
mutagen>=1.47.0          # Audio metadata (ID3 tags) reading

# Note: tkinter is included with Python standard library
# Note: wave module is included with Python standard library

# Optional: For better audio format support
# ffmpeg or ffmpeg-python may be needed for pydub to handle various formats
# Install ffmpeg separately: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
# Or on Windows: choco install ffmpeg
# Or on macOS: brew install ffmpeg
# Or on Linux: sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
